## 1. What the mod does

Pawn Diary watches **colonist** pawns' social **interactions**, **social fights**, and
**mental breaks**, keeps the meaningful ones, and uses an LLM (any OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint — e.g. a local LM Studio / llama.cpp server) to rewrite each
event into a short first-person diary entry. Each pawn's diary is shown in an **inspector
tab next to the vanilla Log tab**.

Only **free colonists** (`pawn.IsColonist`) are eligible for diary entries. Animals,
prisoners, slaves, enemies, and visitors never receive diary entries. When a mixed
interaction involves one eligible colonist and one ineligible pawn (e.g. a colonist
nuzzled by an animal, or a colonist chatting with a prisoner), a **solo** entry is created
for the colonist only — the ineligible pawn's POV is never generated and cannot block the
colonist's entry. Interactions between two ineligible pawns are silently skipped.

Each pawn also has saved diary controls in that tab: a **persona preset** that shapes their
writing voice, and a checkbox to disable LLM diary generation for that pawn while keeping raw
events recorded.

Pairwise events (interactions, social fights) between two eligible colonists produce two
entries — one from each pawn's point of view — by default as **paired sequential POV**:
first the initiator entry, then the recipient entry with the initiator's generated text
included as hidden continuity context. Solo events (mental breaks, or any event where only
one pawn is eligible) produce a single entry from that pawn's point of view.

## 2. File map

**Repository layout** — RimWorld loads only `About/`, the version folder `1.6/`, and `Languages/`.
The C# **source lives in `Source/` (which the game ignores)**; the compiled DLL is written to
`1.6/Assemblies/`:

```

The table lists files by name; all `.cs` live under `Source/<area>/` per the tree above.

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `About/About.xml` | Mod metadata. `packageId = aimml.pawndiary`, supports RimWorld 1.6. |
| `InteractionGroups.cs` | Defines `DiaryInteractionGroupDef : Def` (the group type + `Matches`) and the `InteractionGroups` classifier over the `DefDatabase`. The group **data** now lives in XML (see `1.6/Defs/` below), so groups/prompts are editable without recompiling. |
| `Languages/English/Keyed/PawnDiary.xml` | All player-facing UI strings **and** the natural-language prompt text (event sentences, context words, buckets), resolved via `.Translate()`. See §12 Localization. |
| `Source/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` | Assembly metadata. |
| `Source/PawnDiary.csproj` | Build config (.NET Framework 4.7.2; recursive `**\*.cs` glob, so new files need no project edit), outputs to `1.6/Assemblies/PawnDiary.dll`. `Source/PawnDiary.slnx` is the solution. |
| `DiaryModStartup.cs` | `[StaticConstructorOnStartup]`: applies Harmony patches and injects the Diary `ITab` after the Log tab on humanlike pawn defs. |
| `DiaryPatches.cs` | Harmony postfixes: `PlayLog.Add` → `RecordInteraction`; `MentalStateHandler.TryStartMentalState` → `RecordMentalState` (social fights + mental breaks). |
| `DiaryGameComponent.cs` | Orchestrator: recording, generation queueing, applying results, save/load, lookups. (Context/prompt building and the data models were split into the files below.) |
| `DiaryEvent.cs` | The `DiaryEvent` model: per-POV text, context, prompts, generated text, status; save/load; applying LLM results (incl. legacy dual-POV parse). |
| `PawnDiaryRecord.cs` | The `PawnDiaryRecord` model: one pawn's event-id index + legacy entries + saved persona/generation toggle; save/load. |
| `DiaryContextBuilder.cs` | Static helpers turning game state into the compact context strings (pawn profile, surroundings, relationship/continuity, opinions) + formatting/bucket helpers. |
| `DiaryPromptBuilder.cs` | Static helpers that assemble the final prompt text (single, paired sequential, solo). |
| `LlmClient.cs` | Async HTTP client to the endpoint: queueing, concurrency gate, timeouts, retries, request/response JSON. Defines `LlmGenerationRequest` / `LlmGenerationResult`. |
| `MiniJson.cs` | Dependency-free JSON parser (see §8). |
| `PawnDiarySettings.cs` | All mod settings + clamping + save/load, including per-group enable/instruction overrides (keyed by group `defName`). |
| `DiaryTuningDef.cs` | Defines `DiaryTuningDef : Def` + `DiaryTuning.Current` (tuning knobs: dedup windows, thresholds, buckets). Data lives in XML; falls back to safe code defaults if the Def is absent. |
| `DiaryPromptDef.cs` | Defines `DiaryPromptDef : Def` + `DiaryPrompts.Current` (single-entry instructions, recipient follow-up instruction, legacy dual markers, and the default system prompt). |
| `DiaryPersonaDef.cs` | Defines `DiaryPersonaDef : Def` + `DiaryPersonas` lookup/fallback helpers. Data lives in XML and is selected per pawn. |
| `PawnDiaryMod.cs` | `Mod` class, settings UI, `ModelListClient` (fetch model list), `EndpointUtility` (URL building). |
| `ITab_Pawn_Diary.cs` | The inspector tab that renders a pawn's diary and exposes that pawn's persona/generation controls. |
| `DiaryEntry.cs` | `DiaryEntry` (legacy stored entry) and `DiaryEntryView` (display model: `DisplayText`/`StatusText`/`DebugText`). |
| `1.6/Defs/*.xml` | **Editable data Defs** loaded at startup (no recompile): `DiaryInteractionGroupDefs.xml` (the 16 groups + matchers + prompts), `DiaryTuningDef.xml` (tuning numbers), `DiaryPromptDef.xml` (prompt instructions, legacy markers, system prompt/default persona), and `DiaryPersonaDefs.xml` (selectable writing personas). |

```

**Background generation.** All LLM diary generation is driven by background ticks, never by
UI actions. `GameComponentTick` runs `QueueAllPendingGenerations` every ~2 seconds (120 ticks),
scanning all `not_generated` events and queueing any whose pawns have generation enabled.
This also fires immediately on game load and when a player re-enables generation for a pawn.
Opening the diary tab (`EntriesFor`) is a pure read with no side effects.

---

## 4. Generation modes

Controlled by the `dualPovGeneration` setting.

### Pawn eligibility (colonist-only)

Diary entries are **only generated for free colonists** (`pawn.IsColonist == true`).
Animals, prisoners, slaves, enemies, and visitors are never eligible. This is enforced
at every entry point via `IsDiaryEligible(pawn)` (humanlike + colonist):

- **Two ineligible pawns**: interaction is silently skipped — no event is created.
- **One eligible, one ineligible**: a **solo** event is created for the eligible colonist
  only. The ineligible pawn appears as `otherPawn` context (for opinions/surroundings)
  but never gets a POV or a `PawnDiaryRecord`. This prevents the blocking issue where
  an ineligible initiator (e.g. an animal's Nuzzle) would queue a POV that the eligible
  recipient's entry depends on in sequential mode.
- **Two eligible colonists**: normal pairwise flow (both POVs generated).

This applies uniformly to interactions, social fights, mental breaks, and small-talk
batches. The inspector tab (`ITab_Pawn_Diary`) is also hidden for non-colonist pawns.

### Paired sequential POV (default, `dualPovGeneration = true`)
- Pairwise events start by queueing the initiator request only. Its prompt
  (`BuildSequentialInteractionPrompt(..., "initiator")`) asks for exactly one diary entry.
- When the initiator result is applied, `QueueRecipientAfterInitiatorResult` queues the
  recipient request. The recipient prompt includes the generated initiator entry as
  `initiator diary (hidden context)` and instructs the model not to treat it as something
  the recipient has read.
- If the initiator request fails, the recipient POV is marked failed too, because the
  required hidden context does not exist.
- Old `[INITIATOR]` / `[RECIPIENT]` parser code remains dormant for compatibility, but new
  requests are ordinary one-entry POV requests.

### Single POV (legacy, `dualPovGeneration = false`)
- Both initiator and recipient are queued as separate independent requests at record time.
- Kept for fallback; off by default.

### Solo events (mental breaks)
- `DiaryEvent.solo == true`. Only the breaking pawn is involved (recipient fields blank).
  Generation always uses the single initiator POV via `BuildSoloPrompt` (a `mental_event`
  prompt). The target of a targeted break (e.g. MurderousRage) is named in the text/context
  but does not get their own entry.

All paths share the same per-event context fields and the system prompt.

### Per-pawn persona and generation toggle
- Each `PawnDiaryRecord` saves `personaDefName` and `diaryGenerationEnabled`.
- Persona options are `DiaryPersonaDef` XML Defs in `1.6/Defs/DiaryPersonaDefs.xml`, with
  `DiaryPromptDef.defaultPersonaDefName` providing the fallback/default (`DiaryPersona_StoicSurvivor`).
- The Diary tab creates a pawn's record on first edit/open and shows a checkbox plus persona
  selector above the entries.
- Disabled generation does **not** delete or skip events; it only prevents future LLM requests for
that pawn. The raw event text still appears in the diary.
- Re-enabling generation for a pawn immediately queues any `not_generated` events for that pawn.
- In paired sequential mode, if the initiator has generation disabled but the recipient does not,
  the recipient can still generate from the base event prompt without hidden initiator context.

### Prompt context — signal only, no filler
Prompts are assembled line-by-line via `AppendField`, which **drops any field that is empty
or a placeholder** (`none` / `n/a` / `unknown`). Builders are written to return empty when
there's nothing worth saying, so the model never spends tokens on noise:
- **Persona**: the selected writing-style rule is sent as a `persona:` line, separate from
  gameplay facts such as mood, traits, and relationship.
- **Surroundings** (`BuildSurroundingsSummary`): weather and biome only when **outdoors**;
  temperature only when actually cold (≤0°C) or hot (≥32°C); beauty only when notably nice
  or grim; nearby things / current job only when present.
- **Health** (`BuildHealthSummary`): empty when healthy — only pain, bleeding, downed,
  pain-shock, and notable conditions are sent.
- **Relationship** (`BuildContinuitySummary`): a compact memory line per pawn —
  relation kind (spouse/rival/…) + `opinion ±N (bucket)` + **why** (the top social memories
  driving it, aggregated and signed, via `BuildSocialThoughtsSummary`) + **last wrote** (the
  most recent diary line that pawn produced about the other — a lightweight memory layer for
  continuity).
- Dropped from prompts entirely (still stored on the event): raw per-beat logs,
  `shared_event`, `sequence`, `game`/worker details, and the separate `opinions` line.

---

## 5. Interaction groups (recording + per-group prompt)

Events are organized into **groups**, defined as `DiaryInteractionGroupDef` Defs loaded from
`1.6/Defs/DiaryInteractionGroupDefs.xml` (edit + restart, no recompile). Each group is a single
settings entry with two things: an **enabled toggle** (is it recorded?) and a **diary prompt
instruction** (shared by every event in the group). This replaces the old per-defName
"significant" allowlist *and* the old per-defName instruction map — they are now one system.

Groups have a **domain**: `Interaction` (matches `InteractionDef`s) or `MentalState`
(matches `MentalStateDef`s). Classification is domain-scoped so the two never cross-match:
- `Classify(InteractionDef)` → first matching Interaction-domain group, else **Other**.
- `ClassifyMentalState(MentalStateDef)` → first matching MentalState-domain group, else
  **Mental breaks**.

Matching is by exact `defName` or a substring token; order within a domain matters
(specific themes before generic), with the catch-all last.

**Recording:** `DiaryGameComponent.IsInteractionSignificant(def)` →
`Settings.IsInteractionEnabled(def)` → `IsGroupEnabled(Classify(def).defName)`. So an interaction
is recorded iff its group is enabled.

**Prompt:** `InteractionInstruction(def)` → `Settings.InstructionFor(def)` →
`InstructionForGroup(Classify(def))` (per-group override, else the group's default).

**Groups and default enabled state** (toggle any of these in mod settings):

| Group | Default | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| NSFW / RJW | **on** | `Sex_*`, `Rape_*`, `Necro_*`, `SexTame*`, `Speech_sex` |
| Romance & dating | on | RomanceAttempt, MarriageProposal, Breakup, Psychology dates/hookups, Speech_DateRitual |
| Recruitment & prison | on | BuildRapport, RecruitAttempt, ReduceWill, EnslaveAttempt, SparkJailbreak |
| Slavery | on | Suppress, SparkSlaveRebellion |
| Ideology & conversion | on | ConvertIdeoAttempt, Convert_*, Counsel_*, PreachHealth, WorkDrive, Indoctrinate, Worship |
| Trials & accusations | on | Trial_Accuse, Trial_Defend |
| Anomaly & dark | on | DarkDialogue, CreepyWords, InhumanRambling, OccultTeaching, InterrogateIdentity |
| Insults & fights | on | Insult, Slight, Sentence_SocialFight* |
| Rituals & speeches | on | Speech_* (Funeral, Execution, Leader, …), WordOf* psycasts |
| Animal handling | on | AnimalChat, TameAttempt, TrainAttempt, Nuzzle, ReleaseToWild |
| Heartfelt talk | on | DeepTalk, KindWords, Reassure, SnapOut_CalmDown |
| Teaching & lessons | **off** | Lesson*, BabyPlay |
| Small talk | **off** | Chitchat, Conversation, HangOut, OfferFood, SanguophageChat |
| Other / uncategorized | **off** | anything unmatched (e.g. RiMindInteraction) |
| **Social fights** (mental) | on | `SocialFighting` — pairwise, two POV entries |
| **Mental breaks** (mental) | on | Berserk, Tantrum, Wander_Sad, Binging_*, MurderousRage, … (catch-all for mental states) |

To add/retune groups, edit `1.6/Defs/DiaryInteractionGroupDefs.xml` (`defName`, `label`, `order`,
`domain`, `defaultEnabled`, `instruction`, `matchDefNames`, `matchTokens`, `catchAll`) and restart
— no recompile. `order` controls classification order within a domain (lowest first; keep the
catch-all highest). Group `defName`s are the stable keys player settings save overrides under, so
don't rename them.

**Tuning knobs** (dedup windows, small-talk batching, scan radius/temperature, and the
mood/pain/beauty/opinion bucket thresholds) likewise live in XML —
`1.6/Defs/DiaryTuningDef.xml`, backing `DiaryTuningDef` / `DiaryTuning.Current`. Every value
defaults to the shipped number, so deleting the file or any field changes nothing.

**Small talk batching:** interactions classified into the `smalltalk` group are buffered per
pawn pair instead of queued immediately. The batch flushes when no new small-talk event arrives
for `smallTalkBatchWindowTicks` (default 2500, about one in-game hour), when the pair reaches
`smallTalkBatchMaxEvents` (default 6), or before saving.
Each flushed batch becomes one normal pairwise `DiaryEvent`, so generation still uses the same
paired sequential/single-POV paths as other interactions. Important social groups are not
batched: for example `DeepTalk` is classified under `heartfelt`, so it records and queues
immediately.

**Mental states** are captured via the `MentalStateHandler.TryStartMentalState` postfix:
- `SocialFighting` with an eligible colonist `otherPawn` → a **pairwise** event (both pawns).
  `TryStartMentalState` fires once per participant, so the mirrored call is de-duplicated by
  pair within `SocialFightDedupTicks` (300).
- Any other mental state → a **solo** event from the breaking pawn (de-duplicated per
  pawn+state within `MentalBreakDedupTicks` ≈ one day). A target pawn, if any, is named in
  the text but gets no entry of their own.
- Only eligible colonist pawns are recorded (animal manhunter/panic states and
  non-colonist mental breaks are ignored). Social fights between a colonist and a
  non-colonist are recorded as solo events for the colonist only.

## 6. Settings (`PawnDiarySettings`)

| Setting | Default | Range / notes |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `endpointUrl` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Base URL; `/chat/completions` and `/models` are derived from it. |
| `apiKey` | _(empty)_ | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer` when set. |
| `modelName` | `local-model` | Picked via "Fetch models" or typed. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | 30 | 5–300. **Per-request deadline** — also the "stuck request" purge window (§7). |
| `maxConcurrentRequests` | 4 | 1–16. Max requests in flight at once; the rest queue. **Use 1 for a single local model.** |
| `maxTokens` | 160 | 32–2048. Applied to each one-entry request. |
| `temperature` | 0.8 | 0–2. |
| `dualPovGeneration` | true | Paired sequential vs. independent single-POV requests for both sides (§4). |
| `systemPrompt` | from `DiaryPromptDef` XML | Sent as a `system` message; edit `1.6/Defs/DiaryPromptDef.xml` then click "Restore default" to apply (existing saves persist their saved value). |
| `groupEnabled` / `groupInstructions` | per-group defaults | Maps keyed by `InteractionGroup.Key` (see §5). Absent key = use the group's default enabled state / default instruction. |
| `enableLlm`, `keepRawEntryOnFailure`, `sendApiKeyAsBearerToken` | true | Currently forced on in `ClampValues`. |

Settings UI lives in `PawnDiaryMod.DoSettingsWindowContents` (connection, model fetch,
paired POV toggle, concurrency slider, system prompt editor, and the interaction-group editor —
a checkbox per group plus a prompt editor for the selected group).

Per-pawn diary controls live in `ITab_Pawn_Diary`, not the global mod settings window. They are
stored in each pawn's `PawnDiaryRecord`: persona preset and `diaryGenerationEnabled` (default
enabled).

---

## 7. Concurrency & reliability (`LlmClient`)

- **Queue + gate:** every request passes through a `SemaphoreSlim` sized to
  `maxConcurrentRequests`. At most N are in flight (awaiting a response/error); the rest
  wait in line. Requests are **never dropped** for being "too many".
- **Stuck-request purge:** once a request acquires a slot, a single hard deadline
  (`timeoutSeconds`) covers the whole request **including retries**. When it fires the
  request is abandoned, reported as `"Timed out waiting for the model."`, and the slot is
  freed. The deadline clock starts only after leaving the queue, so waiting in line does
  not count against it.
- **Stale-session purge:** `BeginSession` (new game / load) bumps a session id and cancels
  the old token. Requests from an ended session are dropped instead of wasting a slot.
- **Retries:** up to 3 attempts for transient errors (429, 5xx, network) within the
  deadline; permanent errors (other 4xx, empty content) fail immediately.

---

## 8. RimWorld / Mono constraints (important)

- The mod runs on RimWorld's **Unity Mono runtime**, which only has the assemblies in
  `RimWorldWin64_Data/Managed`. A mod can reference anything at compile time, but
  referencing an assembly not present at runtime causes a `TypeLoadException`.
- **`System.Web.Extensions` / `JavaScriptSerializer` is NOT available at runtime.** JSON is
  therefore parsed with the hand-written `MiniJson` (objects → `Dictionary<string,object>`,
  arrays → `object[]`, etc.). Do not reintroduce `JavaScriptSerializer` or add a NuGet
  JSON library unless it is shipped in the mod's own `Assemblies`.

---

## 9. UI

- **Inspector tab** (`ITab_Pawn_Diary`), injected after the vanilla **Log** tab on all
humanlike pawn defs at startup. The tab is **visible only for free colonists**
(`pawn.IsColonist`); animals, prisoners, slaves, enemies, and visitors never see it.
Renders newest-first: date + status header, the diary
  text (generated, or the raw fallback line while pending/failed), and a small grey debug
  block (event id, POV, endpoint, model, status, error, prompt).
- There is **no** standalone window or gizmo anymore, and **no** colony/neutral events
  view (both removed — see Changelog).

---

## 10. Persistence (save/load)

- `DiaryGameComponent.ExposeData` saves `diaries` (per-pawn records) and `diaryEvents`.
- `DiaryEvent` is `IExposable`; generated text, statuses, errors, and context summaries are
  scribed. Prompts are not scribed (rebuilt on demand).
- Pending requests are not persisted; on load, pending statuses normalize back to
  not-generated and regenerate via the background queue scan.
- **Backward-compat:** dormant `neutral*` fields remain scribed so older saves load; they
  are no longer populated or shown.

---

## 11. Building

From a developer command prompt / MSBuild:

```
MSBuild Source\PawnDiary.csproj /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug
```

Output: `1.6/Assemblies/PawnDiary.dll`. Restart RimWorld (or the save) to load the new DLL.

---

## 12. Localization

The mod is **localization-ready**: every player-facing UI string and every natural-language
word fed to the LLM is a key in `Languages/English/Keyed/PawnDiary.xml`, resolved at runtime via
`"Key".Translate()`. RimWorld resolves `.Translate()` against the **game's active language**, so
translating that one file (plus the DefInjected text below) localizes the whole mod — *including
the prompt the model reads*. That is the point: with the prompt scaffolding also translated, no
stray English biases the model toward writing in English when the player runs a translated game.

**Kept in English on purpose — a stable machine "schema", not prose:**
- The structured prompt **field labels** in `DiaryPromptBuilder` (`event:`, `pov:`, `role:`,
  `with:`, `what you saw:`, `what happened:`, `you:`, `persona:`, `setting:`, `relationship:`,
  `instruction:`, `initiator diary (hidden context):`) and the `key=` summary sub-keys in
  `BuildPawnSummary` (`sex=`, `age=`, `traits=`, `mood=`, `health=`, …).
- The `initiator` / `recipient` role words, and the `none` / `n/a` / `unknown` skip-sentinels
  that `AppendField` filters on.

These read like JSON keys; the (translated) instruction drives the output language. Only the
*values* beside them — buckets (`happy`, `beautiful`, `hostile`…), state words (`outdoors`,
`downed`, `corpse of …`), and full event sentences — are localized.

**Also left in English** (not normal player-facing prose): the greyed `LLM debug` block under
each entry, and `LlmClient` network-error messages — the latter are built on background threads,
where `.Translate()` is not thread-safe.

**Def-based text** (persona `rule`, group `label` / `instruction`, and `DiaryPromptDef`'s
`systemPrompt` + wrapped instructions) is localized the RimWorld way — via
`Languages/<lang>/DefInjected/…`, not Keyed. The English in `1.6/Defs/*.xml` (and the C# field
defaults) is the source/fallback.

**To add a language:** copy `Languages/English` to `Languages/<Language>`, translate the Keyed
values, and (optionally) add `DefInjected` files for the persona/group/prompt Def text.

## 13. Changelog

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **2026-06-15 (shared skill setup for Claude/Codex/OpenCode)**
  - Added a shared repo skill at `skills/pawndiary-engineering/SKILL.md` as the source-of-truth workflow (scope-first, Mono constraints, minimal edits, build validation, doc updates).
  - Added thin wrappers `CLAUDE.md` and `CODEX.md` that point to the shared skill and existing repo rules.
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` to act as the OpenCode wrapper with explicit skill-routing requirements.

- **2026-06-15 (localization-friendly strings)**
  - Moved all UI strings (settings window, diary tab, entry status) and all natural-language
    prompt text (event fallback sentences, surroundings/relationship/health words, and the
    mood/beauty/pain/opinion buckets) into `Languages/English/Keyed/PawnDiary.xml`, resolved via
    `.Translate()`. See §12.
  - Structured prompt field keys (`pov:`, `setting:`, `sex=`, …), the `initiator`/`recipient`
    role words, and the `none`/`n/a`/`unknown` skip-sentinels stay English as a stable schema;
    the `LLM debug` block and background-thread `LlmClient` errors stay English too.
  - No behavior change for English players; a translator can now localize **both** the UI and the
    LLM prompt by translating one Keyed file (plus DefInjected for the persona/group/prompt Defs).

- **2026-06-15 (agent guidance doc rename)**
  - Replaced `CLAUDE.md` with `AGENTS.md` so shared repository agent rules are tool-agnostic.
  - Updated the file-map docs to reference `AGENTS.md`.

- **2026-06-14 (documentation parity fixes)**
  - Corrected the `dualPovGeneration` settings description to match implementation:
    disabling paired mode queues both POV requests independently (not lazily).
  - Corrected persistence docs: pending entries regenerate through the background
    generation scan, not on diary-tab view.

- **2026-06-14 (background-only generation)**
  - All LLM diary generation is now driven by a background tick scan, never by UI actions.
    `EntriesFor` (the diary tab) is a pure read with no side effects.
  - `GameComponentTick` runs `QueueAllPendingGenerations` every ~2 seconds (120 ticks),
    scanning for `not_generated` events and queueing generation where enabled.
  - Generation is also queued immediately on game load and when a pawn's generation is
    re-enabled via the settings checkbox.
  - Single-POV mode now queues both initiator and recipient at record time instead of
    lazily queueing the recipient on tab-open.
  - Small-talk batches no longer flush on diary tab open; they flush purely on timer,
    max-events cap, and save. The doc previously claimed a tab-open flush that was never
    implemented.
  - Removed `FlushSmallTalkBatchesForPawn` (only caller was `EntriesFor`).

- **2026-06-14 (colonist-only diary eligibility)**
  - Diary entries are now generated **only for free colonists** (`pawn.IsColonist`).
    Animals, prisoners, slaves, enemies, and visitors never receive diary entries.
  - Mixed interactions (one colonist + one ineligible pawn) produce a **solo** event for
    the colonist only, preventing the blocking issue where an ineligible initiator (e.g.
    animal Nuzzle) would queue a POV that the colonist recipient's entry depends on in
    sequential mode.
  - Interactions between two ineligible pawns are silently skipped.
  - `RecordMentalState` now requires the breaking pawn to be an eligible colonist; social
    fights between a colonist and a non-colonist produce a solo entry for the colonist.
  - `IsDiaryEligible(pawn)` (humanlike + colonist) replaces the old `IsHumanlike` checks
    throughout recording and event-ref creation.
  - `ITab_Pawn_Diary.IsVisible` now also requires `pawn.IsColonist`, hiding the tab for
    non-colonist humanlikes.
  - Public API guards: `DiaryGenerationEnabledFor`, `SetDiaryGenerationEnabled`,
    `PersonaFor`, `SetPersona` all return early for non-colonist pawns.

- **2026-06-14 (in-game persona layer + per-pawn generation toggle)**
  - Added `DiaryPersonaDef` + `1.6/Defs/DiaryPersonaDefs.xml`, copying the 12 prompt-lab writing
    personas into RimWorld-loaded XML Defs.
  - Added `DiaryPromptDef.defaultPersonaDefName` so the default pawn persona can be changed in XML.
  - Added per-pawn saved fields on `PawnDiaryRecord`: `personaDefName` and
    `diaryGenerationEnabled` (default enabled).
  - Added controls at the top of the pawn Diary inspector tab: persona selector and a checkbox to
    pause LLM generation for that pawn without losing raw recorded events.
  - Prompt builders now include the selected persona as a `persona:` line. Paired sequential
    generation respects disabled pawns and lets an enabled recipient generate without hidden
    initiator context if the initiator is disabled.

- **2026-06-14 (small-talk batching)**
  - Added per-pawn-pair batching for the `smalltalk` interaction group (`Chitchat`,
    `Conversation`, `HangOut`, `OfferFood`, etc.). A batch flushes after a quiet window, at a
    max event count, when either pawn's diary opens, or before save.
  - Added XML-backed tuning knobs: `smallTalkBatchWindowTicks` and
    `smallTalkBatchMaxEvents`.

- **2026-06-14 (paired sequential POV generation)**
  - Replaced live dual-POV generation with a paired sequential flow: initiator request first,
    recipient request second after the initiator result is applied.
  - Rewrote pairwise prompts to request one diary entry at a time. Recipient prompts now include
    the generated initiator entry as hidden continuity context.
  - Updated the settings label/help and prompt Def defaults to match the new behavior. Legacy
    dual-marker parsing remains dormant for compatibility.

- **2026-06-14 (DiaryPromptDef: single XML source of truth for markers/prompts)**
  - Added `DiaryPromptDef` (`Source/Defs/DiaryPromptDef.cs`) + `1.6/Defs/DiaryPromptDef.xml`
    holding `dualInstruction`, `initiatorMarker`, `recipientMarker`, and the `systemPrompt`
    default. Read via `DiaryPrompts.Current` with safe-code-default fallback (same pattern as
    `DiaryTuning`).
  - The old dual prompt/parser path read its markers/instruction from `DiaryPrompts.Current`
    instead of three hardcoded copies.
  - `PawnDiarySettings.DefaultSystemPrompt` is now a property reading from
    `DiaryPrompts.Current.systemPrompt`. Existing saves keep their stored system prompt; edit
    the XML and click "Restore default" in-game to adopt the new default.

- **2026-06-14 (maintainability refactor: rename, split, XML Defs, docs)**
  - **Renamed the project files** `ClassLibrary1.csproj`/`.slnx` → `PawnDiary.*` (the code,
    namespace, assembly, and output DLL were already `PawnDiary`). The mod folder is unchanged
    (RimWorld identifies the mod by `packageId`, not folder name).
  - **Split the 1968-line `DiaryGameComponent.cs`** into focused files with no behavior change:
    `DiaryEvent.cs` + `PawnDiaryRecord.cs` (data models), `DiaryContextBuilder.cs` (context
    summaries + formatting/bucket helpers, now `static`), and `DiaryPromptBuilder.cs` (prompt
    assembly). The component is now a ~570-line orchestrator. Removed the dead `BuildXmlSummary`.
  - **Moved the interaction-group catalog to XML Defs.** `InteractionGroup` is now
    `DiaryInteractionGroupDef : Def`; the 16 groups live in `1.6/Defs/DiaryInteractionGroupDefs.xml`
    and load via `DefDatabase`. Group `defName`s equal the old keys, so saved per-group settings
    still apply. Add/retune groups by editing XML — no recompile.
  - **Moved tuning magic-numbers to a `DiaryTuningDef`** (`1.6/Defs/DiaryTuningDef.xml`, read via
    `DiaryTuning.Current` with a safe-defaults fallback): dedup windows, scan radius/temperature,
    capacity/health thresholds, diary-line length, and the beauty/mood/pain/opinion buckets.
  - **Documentation pass for non-C# maintainers:** added `CSHARP-NOTES.md` (a JS/TS-oriented primer
    on Defs, `IExposable`, Harmony, `ref`/`out`, `async`, LINQ, …), a plain-English header comment on
    every `.cs` file, and XML `///` docs on the main public types/methods.
  - **Organized the repo to RimWorld convention:** moved all C# + `PawnDiary.csproj`/`.slnx` +
    `Properties/` + `Libs/` into a `Source/` folder (the game ignores it), grouped by concern
    (`Core/`, `Models/`, `Generation/`, `Defs/`, `Patches/`, `UI/`, `Settings/`, `Util/`). The root
    now holds only `About/`, `1.6/`, `Languages/`, `Source/`, `prompt-lab/`, and docs. The `.csproj`
    now uses a recursive `**\*.cs` glob (new files auto-included); build is
    `MSBuild Source\PawnDiary.csproj` (output unchanged: `1.6/Assemblies/PawnDiary.dll`).

- **2026-06-13 (persona writing styles)**
  - Added `prompt-lab/personas.txt` — a catalog of 12 writing-style personas (stoic-survivor,
    fiery-hothead, melancholy-dreamer, earnest-optimist, cynical-realist, anxious-worrier,
    gentle-caretaker, grim-veteran, whimsical-eccentric, noble-idealist, bitter-loner,
    eager-socialite) with short voice descriptions.
  - Persona is now a **separate line** in fixturess (`initiator persona: random`,
    `recipient persona: random`, `you persona: random`) — the catalog stays out of the prompt.
    `run.js` resolves `random` to a randomly picked persona description at runtime.
  - Replaced `traits:` field with the persona system in all 6 prompt-lab fixtures.
  - Updated `_system.txt`: the model is now told to match the pawn's writing persona — their
    voice, sentence rhythm, and emotional register — rather than raw trait names.

- **2026-06-13 (prompt-lab)**
  - Added `prompt-lab/` — a dependency-free Node harness to iterate on prompts outside the
    game. Hand-authored fixtures (one per event type: dual interaction, social fight, solo
    mental break, single POV) mirror the mod's compact format using realistic def labels;
    `run.js` fires them at the configured endpoint and prints the response (+ parsed dual
    split). Shared system prompt in `prompts/_system.txt`.

- **2026-06-13 (lean prompt context)**
  - Reworked prompts to send **signal only**. New `AppendField` skips empty/placeholder
    fields; all three prompt builders (single, dual, solo) were rewritten compactly and now
    omit raw logs, `shared_event`, `sequence`, `game`/worker details, and `opinions`.
  - **Conditional context:** weather/biome only outdoors; temperature only when cold/hot;
    beauty only when notable; health omitted when healthy.
  - **Extended relationship (memory layer):** relationship now reads as relation kind +
    `opinion ±N (bucket)` + the social memories driving it (`BuildSocialThoughtsSummary`
    via `ThoughtHandler.GetSocialThoughts`) + the pawn's last diary line about the other.
  - Removed now-dead `BuildSharedEventSummary` and `FormatBeauty`.

- **2026-06-13 (social fights & mental breaks)**
  - Added capture of **mental states** via a `MentalStateHandler.TryStartMentalState`
    postfix (`MentalStateStartPatch`). `SocialFighting` → pairwise diary event (both POVs,
    mirrored-call de-dup); all other mental breaks → **solo** events from the breaking pawn,
    naming any target.
  - Added `DiaryEvent.solo` (single-POV, `BuildSoloPrompt`); `CanQueueDual` returns false for
    solo. Extracted `AddPairwiseEvent` (shared by interactions + social fights) and
    `AddSoloEvent`.
  - Interaction groups gained a **domain** (Interaction / MentalState) with domain-scoped
    classification; added **Social fights** and **Mental breaks** groups (both default on),
    shown under a "Mental states & breaks" header in settings.
  - Resolved the prior caveat: social fights ARE now captured (via the mental-state path, not
    `PlayLogEntry_Interaction`).

- **2026-06-13 (interaction groups)**
  - Consolidated the significance filter and the per-interaction prompt instructions into
    **interaction groups** (`InteractionGroups.cs`). Each group has one enable toggle + one
    diary prompt, edited together in settings. Recording now = "is this interaction's group
    enabled"; the prompt = the group's instruction.
  - Squashed the long per-def list into ~14 themed groups (Romance, Recruitment, Conversion,
    Rituals, Animal, NSFW, Teaching, Small talk, …). Defaults: most on; Teaching, Small talk,
    and Other off.
  - Removed `InteractionPromptTemplates.cs`, `Defs/InteractionPromptTemplates.xml`, and the
    old `SignificantInteractionNames`/`Tokens` sets. Settings now store per-group
    enable/instruction maps (old `interactionInstructions` is dropped; instruction overrides
    from older saves are not migrated).

- **2026-06-13**
  - Fixed runtime crash: replaced `JavaScriptSerializer` with `MiniJson` (Mono lacks
    `System.Web.Extensions`). Generation works again.
  - Added **dual-POV generation** (both entries in one request) behind `dualPovGeneration`
    (default on); kept the single-POV path as a disabled fallback.
  - Added a **system prompt** (configurable, sent as a `system` message).
  - Reworked `LlmClient` into a **queue + concurrency gate** (`maxConcurrentRequests`,
    default 4, range 1–16); overflow waits instead of failing. Added a **per-request hard
    deadline** that purges stuck requests, plus stale-session purge.
  - **Removed event batching** — each significant interaction is now its own diary entry
    (no buffering/merging of beats).
  - **UI rework:** moved the diary from a gizmo + window to an **inspector tab next to the
    Log tab** (`ITab_Pawn_Diary`); **removed the colony/neutral events view**.
  - Added this documentation file.
